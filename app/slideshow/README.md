# Slideshow (homepage re-write)

### Overview

Just so I don't forget what my brilliant idea was . . .

Left hand side of the page should be my nav, it should progress through in order and each element of the nav should be highlighted as wel go. I guess I'll have to fix the nav outside of the article and set javascript listeners to update as I go. Also the nav should be clickable and link to an action that'll autoscroll to that section, or maybe I can leverage anchors to get me what I want.

Todos: 
- Do some kind of blur effect on the photos using SVG (basically rip off Sam)

- Maybe do sub-nav items for my sandbox . . .
- Do some kind of auto-preview of the sandbox app as the background?

- Maybe for flickr do something snazzy where the backgrounds then transition left/right with more images . . . maybe on a timer
